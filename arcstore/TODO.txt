TODO:
================================================
Need to finish the DocObjectRegistry class so that it
will use existing DB objects where they exist, but it needs
to have a way of uniqely identifying the important fields of persistable
class and checking against those.

Once that is done, refactor the Service\Indexes\DocParser class so that it uses
this new class to factory all classes rather than simple using 'new' statements.

Finally, finish the persister class so that it will persist the DocRegistry class, and
it should do so automatically.

Then, write a command to get the information that they are requesting in the format they want
by running queries (queries that may take some time...)




Leyla's desired output format:
================================================
Col1: Vocabulary name
Col2: Term
Col3: Frequency of occurances
Col4: Comma-separated topic list for topics *in this vocabulary*
Col5: Comma-separted list of document identifiers
Col6: Number of unique topics (count of unique ids in col4)
Col7: Number of unique documents (count of unique ids in col5)




Data will be stored in the miscData table as:
